3. Installation


To install TurboPack SynEdit into your IDE, take the following
steps:

  1. Unzip the release files into a directory (e.g., d:\SynEdit).

  2. Start RAD Studio.

  3. Add the source subdirectory (e.g., d:\SynEdit\source) to the
     IDE's library path. For CBuilder, add the hpp subdirectory
     (e.g., d:\SynEdit\source\hpp\Win32\Release) to the IDE's system include path.

  4. Open & install the designtime package specific to the IDE being
     used. The IDE should notify you the components have been
     installed.
